# To do

- 'rosa' is not really pink
- make color test a button click task (dropdown is way too tedious)
- make sentence selection a button click task
  - remove descriptions including elements that do not occur in the picture?
- remove picture for sentence rating in SPR
- Why do we need more colors than "blue", "yellow", "green" and "orange" in the color blind test?
- include information (e.g. "Some Unbiased") in two fields to trial data SPR (one field "quantifier", the other "condition")
- determine which trials each participant sees in the SPR experiment


# What I did

- massaged instructions
- fixed typo 'lilas' (we talked about that)
- fixed typo "pink"
- trial number color naming task
- shuffled response options in color naming task
- shuffled trials in color naming task
- made all of SPR by-word
- added punctuation to SPR
- changed instructions within SPR trials
- pic in SPR invisible during reading after all
